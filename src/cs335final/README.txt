All multimedia files are included. No external libraries are used besides the original
setup that has been used in every single project.

It should be as simple as just importing the project and running it.

Note that if you fullscreen the game clicking the arrows is a bit off because of how it
is calculated. The game is best played with the w, a, s, d keys and a mouse for aiming.

All instructions are on screen for other keys such as 0 to replay, 1, 2, 3 for the speeds.

Please note that we have an avatar for the extra credit.
