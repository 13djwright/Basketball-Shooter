# Basketball-Shooter

Created with Eclipse and JOGL.

To run, install Eclipse, download the files, and import.

JOGL (http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/) is also needed to run.

Latest Stable Version in http://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-current/archive/
Select: jogamp-all-platforms.7z

Uncompress the jogamp-all-platforms.7z file and keep note of its directory.

Within Eclipse, go to Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path

Add gluegen-rt.jar and jogl-all.jar along with the native libraries (\<path\>/jogam-all-platforms/lib/windows-amd54)

Eventually, this project could be updated to include these files already for a conveinent download.
